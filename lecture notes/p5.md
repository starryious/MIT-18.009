# Response to Oscillating Input

$$
\frac{dy}{dt}=ay+\cos \omega t\qquad y=y(0)\;\mbox{at}\;t=0
$$

Look for $y_p(t)=M\cos\omega t+N\sin \omega t$

Just substitute it in the equation to find $M$ and $N$. We get
$$
-aM+\omega N=1
$$

$$
-\omega M-aN=0
$$

solve the system.
$$
M=\frac{-a}{\omega^2+a^2}\qquad N=\frac{\omega}{\omega^2+a^2}
$$
But we think  the form is not beautiful enough. We believe it  can be written in a different way.
$$
y(t)=G\cos (\omega t-\alpha)
$$
 polar coordinates is the right way to think this. $G$ and $\alpha$, a magnitude and an angle. We match that with the form we already had.

Using a little trigonometry here, we can get
$$
M=G\cos\alpha\qquad N=G\sin\alpha
$$
since $\cos^2\alpha+\sin^2\alpha=1$, we get
$$
G=\sqrt{M^2+N^2}\qquad\alpha=\arctan\frac{N}{M}
$$
it is called **sinusoidal identity**. Sinusoid is a word for any mixture of sines and cosines of the same omega  t.

However, There is a link -- the key fact about complex numbers -- Euler's great formula will give us a connection between $\cos t$ and $\sin t$ with $e^{it}$ . Hence we will back to exponentials. This if one more example of a nice source function.
